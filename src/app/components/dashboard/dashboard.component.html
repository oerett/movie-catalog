        This is a movie catalog application where you can explore and search for your favorite movies.
        The application pulls data from a powerful movie database API (OMDb API) that provides detailed information
        about movies, including posters, release years, ratings, and more.

        film. The catalog includes top matches based on your search criteria, making it easy to discover new and popular
        movies!
